**I finish the UnrealCourse C++ in Udemy.

* This is my version of UnrealCourse/S05_TestingGrounds repo and this feature I added at the moment:

1. TargetDelayComponent: Allowed to add in a level Actor and if it used by an PatrolRouteComponent add a custom delay to the target.
2. AR4 with custom pattern: Have an simple system of random pattern in the enemy and player AR4 to add visual variety to the game.
